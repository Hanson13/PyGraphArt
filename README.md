# PyGraphArt

I wrote this code some time ago with the purpose of learning graph algorithms while enjoying it, through the creation of animated images that show how different graph algorithms work. 

So through this code you can do something as follows:

![BFS](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/bfs.gif)
![DFS](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/dfs.gif)
![Prim](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/prim.gif)
![Kruskal](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/kruskal.gif)
![Dijkstra 1](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/dijkstra.png)
![Dijkstra 2](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/dijkstra2.png)
![Dijkstra 3](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyGraphArt/blob/master/doc/dijkstra3.png)

Note that some function may be bugged.

Thank you @incorvengent for your render.py that I somehow edited a bit.
